It allows you to pick a random commander from up to 5 (default legal, can disable though) and then pick from up to 5 cards in the color restrictions(also legal by default, can disable)

so if you want to find a random commander, this is useful! if you want to build an entirely random commander deck, just set the number of cards to 1! If you want to choose from 3, you can do that too. Feel free to use it how you want.

Only thing is don't spam the card, wait for it to load before clicking it again, or you will possibly break the program.
